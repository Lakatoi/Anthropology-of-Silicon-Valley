# Course Schedule

## I. Historic, Economic, and Cultural Roots  
Classic texts on the historical underpinnings of the valley of gold/fruit/mercury/silicon; the military and “counter-cultural” origins of high tech development; ways in which other countries have attempted to replicate (or integrate into) the Silicon Valley. We explore ethnographies that bring us into the different worlds that coexist in the region and end with Bourdieu to discuss how we might use a theoretical framework (e.g. one based on cultural capital and fields) to ground an analysis of complex social phenomena.

## III. Ethnographic Encounters  
We dive deeper into complete ethnographies that have attempted to investigate themes related to Silicon Valley(s): global forms, hacking, tech development in Latin America. Ethnographies from New York to Berlin give us examples of financial and technological development without losing sight of the politics of race, gender, class, and space.

## IV. New Collectivities; New Subjectivities  
We explore new directions and possibilities for research related to hacking and tech entrepreneurship. How might we think about these practices circulating as "global" forms? How do subjects perform risk, flexibility, and participation in their corresponding social worlds? Are “recursive publics” revolutionary and can they provide for new ways to organize and form groups? Or are they just new ways to replicate old hierarchies and processes of exploitation?
