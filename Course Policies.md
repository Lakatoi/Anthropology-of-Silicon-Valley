## Course Policies

# Correspondence  
*Office Hours*: Take advantage of office hours. Ask questions about readings and your papers early in the semester. 

*Email*: Use email to correspond about logistical issues and/or basic questions about the course material. Do not email me about substantive questions. Come to office hours so we can talk through your questions and you can reach a better understanding than is possible through email. 


# Expectations
**Do** attend all classes, arrive on time, and participate.  
**Do** challenge one another (and me) in a respectful manner.  
**Do** come to office hours to talk about course material and general questions about studying, writing, or future plans.  
**Do** inform me as soon as possible if you are a student with disabilities and require specific accommodations for assignments.  
**Do not** use a laptop, tablet, cellphone, or any other smart device for anything other than taking notes.  
**Do not** behave disrespectfully towards your classmates or me.  
**Do not** bring food to sections (drinks are fine). 


# Academic Dishonesty & Plagiarism
As a student at Cal, you are responsible for knowing and abiding by the Student Code of Conduct (available online at http://students.berkeley.edu/uga/conduct.asp. All work submitted by you and that bears your name is presumed to be your own, original work. You may use others’ words or ideas only if you attribute them properly. This means that you identify the original source and extent of your use of the words or ideas of others that you use.
This goal of this course is to improve your critical reading, thinking and writing skills. My accurate evaluation of these skills involves the assumption that your words and ideas are your own. Therefore, using other people’s ideas as your own, in addition to being forbidden in the Student Code of Conduct, interferes with the aims of this course. I have a zero- tolerance policy regarding plagiarism. The first time you use any words or ideas that are not your own without attributing them, whether in your papers or in-class writing assignments, you risk being failed for the course. Reproducing ideas you encounter in online study guides without attributing them, whether through direct quotation or paraphrase, constitutes plagiarism and is thus grounds for failure. Not to mention that those who rely on others’ ideas, rather than taking the intellectual risk and challenge to develop their own, will not improve as writers and thinkers and will thus probably fail even if they don’t get caught. If you are unsure of the expectations for completing an assignment, just ask before you turn in your work! I am more than happy to discuss these matters with you.
Note: You can propose a revision to this plagiarism clause, using readings from class, and submit as one of your weekly responses.

# Disability Accommodations
If you need disability-related accommodations in this class, if you have emergency medical information you wish to share with me, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please inform me as soon as possible by seeing me after class or making an appointment to visit office hours. If you are not currently listed with DSP (Disabled Students’ Program) but believe that you could benefit from their support, you may apply online at http://dsp.berkeley.edu.
