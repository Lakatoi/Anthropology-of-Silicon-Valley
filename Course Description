The Silicon Valley is frequently championed as a model for technological innovation, 
where high revenue generation and disruptive technologies are attributed to a culture of 
competitive collaboration, lean methodologies, and colorblind meritocracy. At the same
time—and especially recently with major tech companies releasing demographic data of
their workforce—it is critiqued for its underlying structures that promote patriarchy, 
racialization, and exploitation. Thus, as the Silicon Valley increasingly becomes less of
a place and more of a protocol for how to work and live, this course will examine how 
related socio-cultural forms and practices (hacking, responsible entrepreneurship, tech 
startup ecosystems) circulate and become re-assembled across boundaries of race, gender,
class, and nation. How can classic and emerging anthropological methodologies and theoretical 
frameworks help us think critically about the complex processes that undergird the “Silicon Valley”?
